# Brief

## The Problem
We’d like you to write a basic calculator with **** branding. You can use whichever
approach you prefer, with or without frameworks. We expect this test to take between 60-90
minutes and suggest that it’s more important that we can see how the development would
continue than for every feature to be present.

Please submit either a zip file, or a turn to a GitHub repo containing your solution, including a
readme file describing how to run the solution and its tests.

## What we are looking for

### Test Coverage
The solution should have excellent unit tests and test coverage.

### Build file
Please provide an automated build file that compiles your code and runs the tests.

### Simplicity

We value simplicity as an architectural virtue and a development practice. Solutions should reflect
the difficulty of the assigned task, and should not be overly complex. Layers of abstraction,
patterns, or architectural features that aren’t called for should not be included.

### Self-explanatory code
The solution you produce must speak for itself. Multiple paragraphs explaining the solution are a
sign that it isn’t straightforward enough to understand purely by reading code, and are not
appropriate.
